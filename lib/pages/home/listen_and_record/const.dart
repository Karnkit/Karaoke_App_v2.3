    [02:26.80]Although it hurts
    [02:29.83]I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
    [02:34.07]Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
    [02:44.69]To try and apologize for my mistakes
    [02:46.78]But I just want you to know

    [02:51.53]I hope he buys you flowers
    [02:56.56]I hope he holds your hand
    [02:59.56]Give you all his hours
    [03:02.84]When he has the chance
    [03:06.58]Take you to every party
    [03:08.84]'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
    [03:12.97]Do all the things I should have done
    [03:16.94]When I was your man
    [03:20.00]Do all the things I should have done

    [00:00.44]When your legs don't work like they used to before
    [00:05.15]And I can't sweep you off of your feet
    [00:10.99]Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
    [00:17.84]Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

    [00:23.62]And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
    [00:32.63]And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
    [00:45.37]And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
    [00:54.11]Maybe just the touch of a hand
    [01:00.40]Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
    [01:06.41]And I just wanna tell you I am

    [01:11.65]So honey now
    [01:14.21]Take me into your loving arms
    [01:22.39]Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
    [01:29.51]Place your head on my beating heart
    [01:34.14]I'm thinking out loud
    [01:36.46]Maybe we found love right where we are

    [01:44.74]When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
    [01:49.62]And the crowds don't remember my name
    [01:54.99]When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
    [02:02.27]I know you will still love me the same

    [02:06.88]'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
    [02:14.31]Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory

    [02:28.59]I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
    [02:38.27]Maybe it's all part of a plan
    [02:43.32]I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
    [02:50.15]Hoping that you'll understand

    [02:55.00]But baby now
    [02:58.77]Take me into your loving arms
    [03:05.43]Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
    [03:12.61]Place your head on my beating heart
    [03:16.82]I'm thinking out loud
    [03:19.84]That maybe we found love right where we are, oh

    [03:27.00]So baby now
    [03:53.02]Take me into your loving arms
    [03:59.48]Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
    [04:05.99]Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
    [04:11.87]I'm thinking out loud
    [04:14.20]That maybe we found love right where we are

    [04:20.82]Oh baby, we found love right where we are (maybe)
    [04:27.68]And we found love right where we are
